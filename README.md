# Expense-tracker
A lightweight single-page Expense Tracker built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Add income or expense entries, view a running balance and totals, and remove transactions. Data is stored in the browser using localStorage so it persists across refreshes. No backend required — just open index.html in your browser.
